This directory holds all the code for the server like the api, views etc.

The "entry.js" is as it's name says is the entry for load the scripts in the server.

**Note:** we you build a new file called "index.js" will be dropped here, this new file is the bundle generated by webpack for the server,
So if you plan to run this server you will have to use the "index.js" file instead of the "entry.js".

Why is that?
Well, if you will use the "SSR" feature you will need to use the new file because it can recognize the css/fonts etc.

But if you wont use the "SSR" then you can just use the entry normally as always you do.
